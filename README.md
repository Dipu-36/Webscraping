This is a simple project that i have used for my learning of Beautiful Soup to parse the HTMl of TimesJobs.
Regular expressions have been used to deal with smooth parsing of texts so that it doesn't throw any error while parsing both the input provided my user and the text parsed from the websites.
It filters out the jobs according to the skill sets that the user is familiar with and also shows a list of only those jobs that havee been posted few days ago.
It will progammatically scrape the website in every 2 minutes to show the latest job postings.
